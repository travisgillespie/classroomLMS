# Note
This website no longer exists. However, I have uploaded the code for others to view or use.

# Overview
I programmed this Learning Management System with HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. It was created to make my job as a teach easier, but this site ended up doing much more than providing me immediate feedback. My students excelled. They learned to fix their mistakes, improve upon their skills, and most important they learned failing doesn't mean give up. A few of the features this site had to offer are listed below.

# Student Site
* New students could create an account with a username and password.
* Students had access to their grade level assignments.
* Assignments could be submitted online.
* Scores were immediately returned.
* Students could resubmit assignments to fix mistakes.
* Students could review previous attempts at any time.

# Admin Site
* On the backend, administrators could review all submitted assignment results.
* Administrators could drill down to specific data by filtering through assignments, grade levels, classrooms, and individual students.
* Data could be downloaded via csv to analize or upload the results into a gradebook
